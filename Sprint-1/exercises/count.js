let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//The = operator in this context is not performing equality checking; instead, it is assigning a new value to the variable count.
//After executing this line, the variable count now holds the value 1.
//A (=) common pattern used to update variable values in programming.
